**MultiPractice** is a very rustic clone of applications such as Duolingo, Memrise or Anki. 

As an avid language learner, I wanted much more languages than Duolingo could provide. Memrise was a good option, as we can create our own courses. But it is quite limited and, being a commercial product, there is always the possibility of the free version being discontinued. My idea was to create something to complement Duolingo, providing all the features I missed.

MultiPractice started as little more than a database of sentences in different languages and a mechanism to manage these sentences and bring them to me at random, with a shy attempt at a spaced repetition algorithm. In its current state, it can organise its contents in lessons, levels and courses, loosely keeping track of the items that need more attention.

As usual, the system is built with my **go!Johnny** library. I hate mixing html markup and and php code. For ease of use, I include go!Johnny in the same directory.
